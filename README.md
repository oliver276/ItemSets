# ItemSets
A client for modifying and creating itemsets for League of Legends

You can download the JAR or the EXE.

To change the directory that the program looks into, start with a commandline of your install directory for League of Legends


Since the new client came out (which is far better :)) there was the distinct lack of itemset creation.  I wrote this small utility (nothing more, and probably not even good at that) to circumvent this.
